notes:

General Header Comments:
	had to manually pad the file header; the numpy alignment doesn't quite work the same way as the c struct alignment
	changed the read methods to a straight np fromfile

Block Header:
	We subclass VLBIHeader
	We define a custom numpy dtype that is a copy of the dspsr block header struct
	Note that Marten wrote this class. The 'fromfile' method is the main thing here and we use the numpy 'frombuffer' method to read bytes straight into the header dtype. These headers are pretty simple since our data are 32bit word-aligned.

File Header:
	basically the same as for the block header; had to define a Fairly extensive dtype but otherwise not much to report.
	Need to deal with header parser despite the fact that the headers are word aligned.

Combined Header:
	Working on it...

Payload:
	define/select encoders (8bit)
	define dtype_word to be int8

	fromfile:
		reviewed superclass read method
		had to get payload_nbytes from block header field
		consequently, always need a non-null header
