The Baseband package provides:

- File input/output functions for supported radio baseband formats, listed under
  :ref:`specific file formats <specific_file_formats_toc>`.
- Data container classes for supported formats, which can be used for accessing
  and manipulating data samples and for generating baseband formats from
  user-defined data.  The latter functionality can be used for converting
  between file formats.
- Classes for reading from and writing to an ordered sequence of files as if
  it was a single file.
