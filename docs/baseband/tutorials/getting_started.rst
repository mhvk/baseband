Getting Started
***************

This tutorial covers the basic features of Baseband.  It assumes that 
`NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and the `Astropy`_ units module have been
imported::

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import astropy.units as u

Reading Files
=============

Opening Files
-------------

Each format supported by Baseband has a master input/output function,
accessible by importing the corresponding format module.  For example, to read
the sample VDIF file that comes with Baseband (sample files can all be found in
the `baseband.data` module)::

    >>> import baseband.vdif as vdif
    >>> from baseband.data import SAMPLE_VDIF
    >>> fh = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs')

To close the file::

    >>> fh.close()

Similar syntax can be used to open a file of any format.  To open Baseband's
sample DADA file, for example::

    >>> from baseband import dada
    >>> from baseband.data import SAMPLE_DADA
    >>> fh_dada = dada.open(SAMPLE_DADA, 'rs')
    >>> dada_data = fh_dada.read()
    >>> fh_dada.close()

In general, file I/O and data manipulation use the same syntax across all
file formats.  When using ``open`` for Mark 4 and Mark 5B files, however, two
keywords - ``ntrack``, and ``decade`` - may need to be set manually.  For these
and VDIF, ``sample_rate`` may also need to be passed if it can't be read
or inferred from the file.  Notes on such features and quirks of individual
formats can be found in the docstrings of their ``open`` functions, and
within the :ref:`Specific file format <specific_file_formats_toc>`
documentation.

For the rest of this section, let's go back to using VDIF files.

Decoding Data and the Sample File Pointer
-----------------------------------------

We gave `~baseband.vdif.open` the ``'rs'`` flag, which opens the file in
"stream reader" mode.  The function returns an instance of
`~baseband.vdif.base.VDIFStreamReader`, a wrapper around `io.BufferedReader`
that adds methods to decode files as |data frames| and seek to and read data
|samples|.  To decode the first 12 samples into a `~numpy.ndarray`, we would
use the `~baseband.vdif.base.VDIFStreamReader.read` method::

    >>> fh = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs')
    >>> d = fh.read(12)
    >>> type(d)
    <... 'numpy.ndarray'>
    >>> d.shape
    (12, 8)
    >>> d[:, 0].astype(int)    # First thread.
    array([-1, -1,  3, -1,  1, -1,  3, -1,  1,  3, -1,  1])

As discussed in detail in the :ref:`VDIF section <vdif>`, VDIF files are
sequences of data frames, each of which is comprised of a :term:`header` (which
holds information like the time at which the data was taken) and a
:term:`payload`, or block of data.  Multiple concurrent time streams can be
stored within a single frame; each of these is called a ":term:`channel`". 
Moreover, groups of channels can be stored over multiple frames, each of which
is called a ":term:`thread`".  Our sample file is an "8-thread, single-channel
file" (8 concurrent time streams with 1 stream per frame), and in the example
above, ``fh.read`` decoded the first 12 samples from all 8 threads, mapping
thread number to the second axis of the decoded data array.  Reading files with
multiple threads and channels will produce 3-dimensional arrays.

If you want to know the shape of a :term:`complete sample` - the set of samples
from all available threads and channels for one point in time - it is
accessible through::

    >>> fh.sample_shape
    SampleShape(nthread=8)

By default, dimensions of length unity are |squeezed|, or removed from the
sample shape.  To retain them, we can pass ``squeeze=False`` to
`~baseband.vdif.open`:

    >>> fhns = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs', squeeze=False)
    >>> fhns.sample_shape    # Sample shape now keeps channel dimension.
    SampleShape(nthread=8, nchan=1)
    >>> d2 = fhns.read(12)
    >>> d2.shape             # Decoded data has channel dimension.
    (12, 8, 1)
    >>> fhns.close()

We can access information about the file by printing ``fh``::

    >>> fh
    <VDIFStreamReader name=... offset=12
        sample_rate=32.0 MHz, samples_per_frame=20000,
        sample_shape=SampleShape(nthread=8),
        complex_data=False, bps=2, edv=3, station=65532,
        start_time=2014-06-16T05:56:07.000000000>

The ``offset`` gives the current location of the sample file pointer - it's at
``12`` since we have read in 12 (complete) samples.  If we called ``fh.read
(12)`` again we would get the next 12 samples.  If we instead called
``fh.read()``, it would read from the pointer's *current* position to the end
of the file.  If we wanted all the data in one array, we would move the file
pointer back to the start of file, using ``fh.seek``, before reading::

    >>> fh.seek(0)      # Seek to sample 0.  Seek returns its offset in counts.
    0
    >>> d_complete = fh.read()
    >>> d_complete.shape
    (40000, 8)

We can also move the pointer with respect to the end of file by passing ``2``
as a second argument::

    >>> fh.seek(-100, 2)    # Second arg is 0 (start of file) by default.
    39900
    >>> d_end = fh.read(100)
    >>> np.array_equal(d_complete[-100:], d_end)
    True

``-100`` means 100 samples before the end of file, so ``d_end`` is equal to
the last 100 entries of ``d_complete``.  Baseband only keeps the most recently
accessed data frame in memory, making it possible to analyze (normally large)
files through selective decoding using ``seek`` and ``read``.

.. note::

    Cation should be used when decoding large blocks of data using
    ``fh.read``.  For typical files, the resulting arrays are far too
    large to hold in memory.

To determine where the pointer is located, we use ``fh.tell()``::

    >>> fh.tell()
    40000
    >>> fh.close()

Seeking and Telling in Time With the Sample Pointer
---------------------------------------------------

We can use ``seek`` and ``tell`` with units of time rather than samples.  To do
this with ``tell``, we can pass an appropriate `astropy.units.Unit` object to
its optional ``unit`` parameter::

    >>> fh = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs')
    >>> fh.seek(40000)
    40000
    >>> fh.tell(unit=u.ms)
    <Quantity 1.25 ms>

Passing the string ``'time'`` reports the pointer's location in absolute time::

    >>> fh.tell(unit='time')
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2014-06-16T05:56:07.001250000>

We can also pass an absolute `astropy.time.Time`, or a positive or negative time
difference `~astropy.time.TimeDelta` or `astropy.units.Quantity` to ``seek``.
If the offset is a `~astropy.time.Time` object, the second argument to seek is
ignored.

::

    >>> from astropy.time.core import TimeDelta
    >>> from astropy.time import Time
    >>> fh.seek(TimeDelta(-5e-4, format='sec'), 2)  # Seek -0.5 ms from end.
    24000
    >>> fh.seek(0.25*u.ms, 1)  # Seek 0.25 ms from current position.
    32000
    >>> # Seek to specific time.
    >>> fh.seek(Time('2014-06-16T05:56:07.001125'))
    36000

We can retrieve the time of the first sample in the file using ``start_time``,
the time immediately after the last sample using ``stop_time``, and the time
of the pointer's current location (equivalent to ``fh.tell(unit='time')``)
using ``time``::

    >>> fh.start_time
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2014-06-16T05:56:07.000000000>
    >>> fh.stop_time
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2014-06-16T05:56:07.001250000>
    >>> fh.time
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2014-06-16T05:56:07.001125000>
    >>> fh.close()

Extracting Header Information
-----------------------------

The first header of the file is stored as the ``header0`` attribute of the
stream reader object; it gives direct access to header properties via keyword
lookup::

    >>> with vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs') as fh:
    ...     header0 = fh.header0
    >>> header0['frame_length']
    629

The full list of keywords is available by printing out ``header0``::

    >>> header0
    <VDIFHeader3 invalid_data: False,
                 legacy_mode: False,
                 seconds: 14363767,
                 _1_30_2: 0,
                 ref_epoch: 28,
                 frame_nr: 0,
                 vdif_version: 1,
                 lg2_nchan: 0,
                 frame_length: 629,
                 complex_data: False,
                 bits_per_sample: 1,
                 thread_id: 1,
                 station_id: 65532,
                 edv: 3,
                 sampling_unit: True,
                 sampling_rate: 16,
                 sync_pattern: 0xacabfeed,
                 loif_tuning: 859832320,
                 _7_28_4: 15,
                 dbe_unit: 2,
                 if_nr: 0,
                 subband: 1,
                 sideband: True,
                 major_rev: 1,
                 minor_rev: 5,
                 personality: 131>

A number of derived properties, such as the time (as a `~astropy.time.Time`
object), are also available through the header object.

    >>> header0.time
    <Time object: scale='utc' format='isot' value=2014-06-16T05:56:07.000000000>

These are listed in the API for each header class.  For example, the sample
VDIF file's headers are of class::

    >>> type(header0)
    <class 'baseband.vdif.header.VDIFHeader3'>

and so its attributes can be found `here <baseband.vdif.header.VDIFHeader3>`.

Reading Specific Components of the Data
---------------------------------------

By default, ``fh.read()`` returns complete samples, i.e. with all
available threads, polarizations or channels. If we were only interested in
decoding a :term:`subset` of the complete sample, we can select specific
components by passing indexing objects to the ``subset`` keyword in open.  For
example, if we only wanted thread 3 of the sample VDIF file::

    >>> fh = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs', subset=3, squeeze=False)
    >>> fh.sample_shape
    SampleShape(nthread=1, nchan=1)
    >>> d = fh.read(20000)
    >>> d.shape
    (20000, 1, 1)
    >>> fh.subset
    (slice(3, 4, None),)
    >>> fh.close()

Since ``squeeze=False``, ``subset`` is converted from ``3`` to ``slice(3, 4,
None)`` to retain dimensions of length unity.  This behaviour is turned off
when ``squeeze=True`` (see below).

Data with multi-dimensional samples can be subset by passing a `tuple` of
indexing objects with the same dimensional ordering as the sample shape prior
to squeezing (in the case of VDIF this is threads, then channels).  For
example, if we wished to select threads 1 and 3, and channel 0::

    >>> fh = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs', subset=([1, 3], 0), squeeze=False)
    >>> fh.sample_shape
    SampleShape(nthread=2, nchan=1)
    >>> fh.close()

If a `tuple` is not used when subsetting multi-dimensional data, ``subset``
will only act upon the the first dimension::

    >>> fh = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs', subset=[1, 3], squeeze=False)
    >>> fh.sample_shape
    SampleShape(nthread=2, nchan=1)
    >>> fh.close()

No enclosing `tuple` is required for data with single-dimensional samples.

If ``squeeze=True``, dimensions of length unity are removed from the decoded
data after subsetting::

    >>> fh = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs', subset=([1, 3], 0))
    >>> fh.sample_shape
    SampleShape(nthread=2)
    >>> fh.close()

Generally, ``subset`` accepts any object that can be used to `index
<https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/arrays.indexing.html>`_ a
`numpy.ndarray`, including advanced indexing (as done above, with
``subset=([1, 3], 0)``).  If possible, slices should be used instead
of list of integers, since indexing with them returns a view rather
than a copy and thus avoid unnecessary processing and memory allocation.

.. _getting_started_writing:

Writing to Files and Format Conversion
======================================

Writing to a File
-----------------

To write data to disk, we again use ``open``.  Writing data in a particular
format requires both the header and data samples.  For modifying an existing
file, we have both the old header and old data handy.

As a simple example, let's read in the 8-thread, single-channel sample VDIF
file and rewrite it as an single-thread, 8-channel one, which, for example, may
be necessary for compatibility with `DSPSR
<https://github.com/demorest/dspsr>`_::

    >>> import baseband.vdif as vdif
    >>> from baseband.data import SAMPLE_VDIF
    >>> fr = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs')
    >>> fw = vdif.open('test_vdif.vdif', 'ws',
    ...                nthread=1, nchan=fr.sample_shape.nthread,
    ...                sample_rate=fr.sample_rate,
    ...                samples_per_frame=fr.samples_per_frame // 8,
    ...                complex_data=fr.complex_data, bps=fr.bps,
    ...                edv=fr.header0.edv, station=fr.header0.station,
    ...                time=fr.start_time)

The minimal parameters needed to generate a file are listed under the
documentation for each format's ``open``, though comprehensive lists can be
found in the documentation for each format's stream writer class (eg. for
VDIF, it's under `~baseband.vdif.base.VDIFStreamWriter`).  In practice we
specify as many relevant header properties as available to obtain a particular
file structure.  If we possess the *exact* first header of the file, it can
simply be passed to ``open`` via the ``header`` keyword.  In the example above,
though, we manually switch the values of ``nthread`` and ``nchan``.  Because
VDIF EDV = 3 requires each frame's payload to contain 5000 bytes, and ``nchan``
is now a factor of 8 larger, we decrease ``samples_per_frame``, the number of
complete (i.e. all threads and channels included) samples per frame, by a
factor of 8.

Encoding samples and writing data to file is done by passing data arrays into
``fw``'s `~baseband.vdif.base.VDIFStreamWriter.write` method.  The first
dimension of the arrays is sample number, and the remaining dimensions must be
as given by ``fw.sample_shape``::

    >>> fw.sample_shape
    SampleShape(nchan=8)

In this case, the required dimensions are the same as the arrays from
``fr.read``.  We can thus write the data to file using::

    >>> while fr.tell() < fr.size:
    ...     fw.write(fr.read(fr.samples_per_frame))
    >>> fr.close()
    >>> fw.close()

For our sample file, we could simply have written

    ``fw.write(fr.read())``

instead of the loop, but for large files, reading and writing should be done in
smaller chunks to minimize memory usage.  Baseband stores only the data frame
or frame set being read or written to in memory.

We can check the validity of our new file by re-opening it::

    >>> fr = vdif.open(SAMPLE_VDIF, 'rs')
    >>> fh = vdif.open('test_vdif.vdif', 'rs')
    >>> fh.sample_shape
    SampleShape(nchan=8)
    >>> np.all(fr.read() == fh.read())
    True
    >>> fr.close()
    >>> fh.close()

File Format Conversion
----------------------

It is often preferable to convert data from one file format to another that
offers wider compatibility, or better fits the structure of the data.  As an
example, we convert the sample Mark 4 data to VDIF.

Since we don't have a VDIF header handy, we pass the relevant Mark 4 header
values into `vdif.open <baseband.vdif.open>` to create one.

    >>> import baseband.mark4 as mark4
    >>> from baseband.data import SAMPLE_MARK4
    >>> fr = mark4.open(SAMPLE_MARK4, 'rs', ntrack=64, decade=2010)
    >>> spf = 640       # fanout * 160 = 640 invalid samples per Mark 4 frame
    >>> fw = vdif.open('m4convert.vdif', 'ws', edv=1, nthread=1,
    ...                samples_per_frame=spf, nchan=fr.sample_shape.nchan,
    ...                sample_rate=fr.sample_rate, complex_data=fr.complex_data,
    ...                bps=fr.bps, time=fr.start_time)

We choose ``edv = 1`` since it's the simplest VDIF EDV whose header includes a
sampling rate. The concept of threads does not exist in Mark 4, so the file
effectively has ``nthread = 1``.  As discussed in the :ref:`Mark 4
documentation <mark4>`, the data at the start of each frame is effectively
overwritten by the header and are represented by invalid samples in the stream
reader.  We set ``samples_per_frame`` to ``640`` so that each section of
invalid data is captured in a single frame.

We now write the data to file, manually flagging each invalid data frame::

    >>> while fr.tell() < fr.size:
    ...     d = fr.read(fr.samples_per_frame)
    ...     fw.write(d[:640], invalid_data=True)
    ...     fw.write(d[640:])
    >>> fr.close()
    >>> fw.close()

Lastly, we check our new file::

    >>> fr = mark4.open(SAMPLE_MARK4, 'rs', ntrack=64, decade=2010)
    >>> fh = vdif.open('m4convert.vdif', 'rs')
    >>> np.all(fr.read() == fh.read())
    True
    >>> fr.close()
    >>> fh.close()

For file format conversion in general, we have to consider how to properly
scale our data to make the best use of the dynamic range of the new encoded
format. For VLBI formats like VDIF, Mark 4 and Mark 5B, samples of the same
size have the same scale, which is why we did not have to rescale our data when
writing 2-bits-per-sample Mark 4 data to a 2-bits-per-sample VDIF file.
Rescaling is necessary, though, to convert DADA or GSB to VDIF.  For examples
of rescaling, see the ``baseband/tests/test_conversion.py`` file.
