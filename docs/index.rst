Baseband
********

Welcome to the Baseband documentation!  Baseband is a package
`affiliated <https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`_ with the
Astropy_ project for reading and
writing VLBI and other radio baseband files, with the aim of simplifying and
streamlining data conversion and standardization.  It provides:

- File input/output objects for supported radio baseband formats, enabling
  selective decoding of data into `Numpy arrays <numpy.ndarray>`, and encoding
  user-defined arrays into baseband formats. Supported formats are listed under
  :ref:`specific file formats <specific_file_formats_toc>`.
- The ability to read from and write to an ordered sequence of files as if it
  was a single file.

It can be extended with the more experimental baseband-tasks_ package,
which provides tasks to, e.g., `~baseband_tasks.channelize.Channelize`
or `~baseband_tasks.dispersion.Dedisperse` sample streams.
