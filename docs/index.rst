Baseband
********

Welcome to the Baseband documentation!  Baseband is a package
`affiliated <https://www.astropy.org/affiliated/index.html>`_ with the
`Astropy project <https://www.astropy.org>`_ for reading and
writing VLBI and other radio baseband files, with the aim of simplifying and
streamlining data conversion and standardization.  It provides:

- File input/output objects for supported radio baseband formats, enabling
  selective decoding of data into `Numpy arrays <numpy.ndarray>`, and encoding
  user-defined arrays into baseband formats. Supported formats are listed under
  :ref:`specific file formats <specific_file_formats_toc>`.
- The ability to read from and write to an ordered sequence of files as if it
  was a single file.

If you used this package in your research, please cite it via DOI
